    "description": "I'm a young man with a passion for new technologies, computing and programming. My favorite programming languages are JavaScript, React, Python, Node.js, Express, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Git. In 2021, I discovered my passion for coding by completing some simple projects with HTML/CSS. However, it was in 2023 that I decided to fully dive into the world of coding, and since then, I have learned many new technologies.",
